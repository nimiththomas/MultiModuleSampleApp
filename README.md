### üöÄ Android Multimodule Template
A modular, scalable, and maintainable Android project template built using modern Android development practices. This project is intended to serve as a reference for developers exploring the multimodular approach in Android. It is not a production-ready app but a code-driven showcase of clean architecture and modularization techniques.

### üìù Description
This template demonstrates a fully decoupled Android app structure using Jetpack Compose, Kotlin, and modern Android development tools. The goal is to showcase a clean architecture pattern with separation of concerns, making development, testing, and scaling easier for complex Android apps.

### Technologies used:
* Kotlin
* Jetpack Compose
* Retrofit (for network calls)
* Jetpack DataStore (for local persistence)
* Compose Navigation 2
* Coroutines (for async operations)
*Dark Mode Support

### üìÇ Layer Breakdown

## build-logic/
Contains custom Gradle plugins to simplify setup across modules.
Centralizes build configuration (e.g., Kotlin/Compose compiler settings, dependency versions).
Promotes DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles for build scripts.

## core/
 
## network/
Retrofit setup, API interfaces, interceptors, and network config.

## datastore/
DataStore instance and related getters/setters for persistent storage.

## data/
Connects with both network and datastore to provide data to the app.
Hosts repositories that abstract data sources and expose data to the domain layer.
Depends on:
network/
datastore/

## domain/
Pure Kotlin modules with no Android dependencies.
Contains use cases that wrap around repositories and apply business logic.
Depends on:
data/

## common/
Shared utility classes and model definitions.
Promotes reuse across all modules.

## designsystem/
Centralized color definitions, typography, and theme support (including dark mode).
Ensures consistent UI across modules.

## uicomponents/
Contains reusable Composable UI components (buttons, cards, etc.).
Built on top of the designsystem.
Depends on:
designsystem/

## feature/ 

## feature1/ & feature2/
Self-contained features including:
Navigation graph
Screens
ViewModels
UI state management

Depends on:
domain/
common/
uicomponents/
designsystem/

## üì± app/
Main entry point of the application.
Injects and assembles all features.
Applies theming via the design system.


### ‚úÖ Advantages of This Approach
* Scalability: Easily extendable with new features and modules.
*Separation of concerns: Clean boundaries between layers.
*Reusability: Design system, utils, and components are shareable.
*Build efficiency: Modules can be built in isolation.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disadvantages
* Initial Complexity: The learning curve for beginners can be steep.
* Overhead for Small Projects: Might be overkill for simple apps.
* Setup Time: Setting up modules and wiring dependencies takes time.

### üõ†Ô∏è How to Clone and Use
* git clone https://github.com/nimiththomas/MultiModuleSampleApp.git
* Open in Android Studio
* Open Android Studio.
* Choose "Open an existing project".
* Navigate to the cloned directory.
* Let Gradle sync complete.
* Build & Run
* Select the app module.
* Hit Run ‚ñ∂Ô∏è on your emulator/device.
